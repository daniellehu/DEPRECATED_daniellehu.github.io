                            Without diving too much into details, Microsoft&rsquo;s WPT has an internal
                            website that displays pertinent information to our team about website domains (i.e. bug information,
                            trend information, etc.). In order to create a more efficient experience while browsing websites, our team
                            decided to create an extension that paralleled our internal website. This meant
                            working on a relatively new technology for Microsoft Edge (since extensions only
                            started rolling out in the Windows Anniversary Edition). The backend was built in C#, while the frontend
                            was built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.<br><br>

                            weeks of being a web developer for this team, I was heavily involved with frontend work in order to make PeerPresents
                            more presentable to our users. We needed to be able to deploy our system to classrooms and therefore wanted to focus
                            on improvements of the UI.<br><br>
                            &bull; Provided feedback for the reworking of a new UI during weekly SCRUM sessions and team meetings<br>
                            &bull; Implemented frontend of new interface and design<br>
                            &bull; Changed application to be more mobile and tablet friendly<br>
                            &bull; Fixed layout issues throughout the system<br><br>

                            <i><u>Implementing A/B test:</u></i><br>
                            Towards the latter part of the semester, our team wanted to test new features to further the study of optimizing our tool. Brainstorming for this new topic was a process that took a few weeks, but in the end, we decided to test the impact of the tool&rsquo;s interface on the user&rsquo;s actions. In particular, we wanted to know whether a split version of an interface versus a combined version of an interface led to people commenting / voting more. For our system, people can comment their own thoughts. In addition, they can look at other feedback given from their peers and vote on  those feedback. We decided to implement an AB-test where version A supported a split interface and version B supported a combined view. We hypothesized that the split display would lead to more commenting and less voting since switching between the tabs may be a deterring factor, and that the combined display would lead to less and more conservative commenting from users, yet more votes for other comments.<br><br>
                            Our team brainstormed the design of the whole test and the interface of the new system in the first few weeks. Afterwards, it was a matter of implementing the two versions in our existing code-base. We randomly assigned the students to either group A or group B. Their account names were tracked in our database in order to figure out the switching of the groups. So for the first 2 weeks students in group A witnessed a split view of the interface, while the rest of the students spent it in group B with the combined views. After 2 weeks, we simply switched the students to the opposite group.<br><br>

                            Our web application needed to be fully functional for our classroom deployments. We planned to deploy to a particular class and have them use PeerPresents versus handwritten notecards for feedback.

                            In spring of 2016, my role in Peer Presents involved less development, and more analysis of our datasets. After deploying to two classrooms in the fall semester, our team gathered over 6000 real-time feedback comments from actual students in a classroom setting. I digitized a lot of the non-PeerPresents feedback comments that were provided by students on notecards. This step was rather long and tedious, but after a lot of the data was sorted and imported into excel sheets, our analysis of the actual data started kicking in.
                            <br><br>
                            I, along with our PhD lead and our other PhD developer, worked on coding the feedback comments that we received. This &ldquo;coding&rdquo; meant categorizing each comment by a student into respective labels. These labels help provide more context to whether or not PeerPresents is a more/less effective system for feedback commenting. Although I fixed bugs here and there, the majority of my work in the second semester involved reading notecards and excel sheets to try and clean the process of analyzing the data.<br><br>

                            We (as in Kevin and I) decided to make use of the last half of our summer. Kevin proposed the idea of working on an interesting project to me sometime, and I was quite eager to work on anything web related (I had just spent the summer learning about the basics of HTML & CSS & JS).<br>
                        </p>

                            Kevin&rsquo;s contributions were mostly backend, while I helped with the frontend. We were able to download approximately 8 GBs of Wikipedia text data, and preprocess the information by parsing the collected text into a four-gram table using a combination of Python 2.7, as well as SQLite (sqlite3). Therefore, at the end of the preprocessing, we held an 8 GB database of words in Wikipedia and their statistically probable follow-up words.

                            Afterwards, it was a matter of setting up a way to query the results when an input was given, and setting up the web application to host this service on. We used Flask as our web framework to easily interface with Python. Eventually, we created an interface that was direct in its features, as well as elegantly flat.<br><br>

                            Unfortunately, this project is still on-going. But when I say on-going, I simply mean it&rsquo;s on hold. Kevin and I never fully finished the project, and although it can fully function and output a generated Wikipedia article, it can always be better. A big factor of not finishing is that our query process needs to improve. As of right now, some phrases simply won&rsquo;t generate any text due to the fact that our database doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with the data. So you can&rsquo;t exactly just type anything you wanted and get a result at the end. You may have to prompt the data to flow some more, or you may have to simply search for something more common. A part of this may be the fact that we have a small database (compared to the whole Wikipedia DB), but another part could simply be us not being creative enough to query results. We&rsquo;re working on making this experience very simple and functional for users, and that is why this project is still marked as a &ldquo;present&rdquo; project.

                            <a class="content-a" target="_blank" href="http://earthmodel.azurewebsites.net">Model Our World</a> was a project that aimed to promote interests combining big data, earth sciences, modeling (including machine learning), and cloud services. Our group created a web application as part of Microsoft&rsquo;s global hackathon event <span class="important">//OneWeek</span>. The project focuses on taking various large public datasets related to earth sciences (i.e. ocean temperatures, surface temperatures, precipitation, etc.) and providing an interface for users to interact with to display various data models. The majority of the technologies used for the project were Microsoft related (Bing Maps, Azure ML, Azure Web Services, Azure Blob Storage, SQL Azure, C#, etc.)<br><br>

                            <b>PROJECT BREAKDOWN</b><br>
                            The week before <span class="important">//OneWeek</span> was largely spent planning and discussing ideas related to our project. We needed to prepare beforehand in order to start uploading large datasets into Azure Cloud Services. Once we decided on a set of variables we wanted to measure over time, we uploaded large packets of data into Azure Blob Storage. The days before the hackathon started were spent interpreting those blobs and parsing them into more usable formats. Once they were ready, we put them into Azure SQL Tables.<br><br>
                            A large part of this project was creating a RESTful service that could be reused by programmers and scientists easily. We spent a large amount of time developing this API to be adaptable and easy to use so that it can be recycled for years to come. The service was developed in C# and acts as a middleman between our backend servers and the frontend displays.<br><br>
                            Another part that was focused on was an attempt to provide a model for our users using machine learning. Because we had such large datasets, we planned to utilize Microsoft technologies to produce a model that would map out possible outcomes of our Earth Model. We dived into published research papers and Azure ML in order to better understand the model to create, but weren&rsquo;t able to complete this step by the end of the hackathon.<br><br>

                            Began by learning basics of web development and design the summer before my sophomore year. Practiced these concepts by creating an informal personal website. Worked and improved on this website over time. The summer before my junior year, I refactored the website to
                            a more professional/official style. This portfolio will continuously be modified as time progresses.<br><br>

                            <b>DESIGNING</b><br>
                            A large part of creating this personal website was simply knowing what to build. My first website was built to focus on visual appeal.
                            I would scan various designs made by companies, designers, and students in order to find inspiration. Once a good amount of ideas
                            were in place, I would jot down these designs on paper or on OneNote. When it came time to building the actual website, I would change
                            to Illustrator to gather a more detailed mock-up using images and texts that were going to be used.<br><br>

                            The idea of <a class="content-a" target="_blank" href="http://www.daniellehu.com/personal">this</a> website was to be as informal, yet personal, as I could be. I didn&rsquo;t plan for the website to focus on presenting myself in a professional setting. Instead, the main goal was to simply focus on familiarizing myself with HTML, CSS, and JS.<br><br>
                            <i>About page&rsquo;s description (notice the copious amounts of puns made)</i><br>

                        </p>
                        <p class="card-content_load2s">
                            The website was structured in a way that divided the sections (about, projects, experiences, etc.) into separate pages. There was a central &ldquo;home page&rdquo; that allowed for the user to go to any one of these pages. From there, you can visit any other section by clicking the menu hamburger to bring up a hidden menu. This menu contained links to the other pages, as well as links to external websites (i.e. Github, LinkedIn, etc.) and contact information.<br><br>

                            <b>VERSION TWO</b><br>
                            What you see right now for <span class="important">daniellehu.com</span> is considered version two. It is my second iteration of design and content. The new version focuses more on presenting information to the user in a straightforward and concise manner, intending to help facilitate any exchange of information about me professionally. This initiative was brought up after spending a summer learning about the role of a program manager (at Microsoft). I found more importance in building a product for my users, which would most likely be recruiters from companies.<br><br>

                            Ideally, in the future, developments in design, UI, and UX will continue to improve. Another intended change would be the shift of this static portfolio into a dynamic one, built with an actual web framework. As of right now, this website is hosted through Github Pages, meaning the deployment of the website needed to be in a straightforward, static format. However, until I am able to host this website on my own server, the contents of this portfolio will remain static.

                            Philly Home Finder helps users find suitable neighborhoods that match their preferences in the city of Philadelphia. For Pennapps Fall 2015, our group created <span class="important">a web application that allows users to set certain parameters based on what they would like to see in their neighborhood</span> (i.e. better education, parks, etc.). The application then takes those parameters and synthesizes them with data from a large collection of civil data for Philadelphia.<span class="important"> The application would then map and color code suitable neighborhoods (based on zip-codes) for an easy user experience</span>. We used Flask to develop the framework, as well as Microsoft Azure&rsquo;s DocumentDB for creating the database.

                            Unfortunately, this project was made for a 36-hour hackathon. What this means is that our documentation and the overall sustainability for this project isn&rsquo;t very high. We turned to resources that were temporarily free (i.e. Microsoft Azure) in order to deploy our solution, but that means that after about a week/month, our resources ran out of their &ldquo;free trial&rdquo; statuses, and we&rsquo;re now left with not-so-free and not-so-working projects. If you wanted to try and build the solution with Microsoft VS yourself, it&rsquo;d actually throw an error due to the inactive state of our DB. So a demo of our project is a bit difficult to get to, but if you do REALLY want to see it, please just shoot me an email and I can figure out some of the details to fixing up a demo.

                            <b>HOW IT WORKS</b><br>
                            The game largely consisted of interacting between our web server and Snapchat&rsquo;s server using a third-party Snapchat API. This API allowed us to connect to an account, send snaps, receive snaps, and therefore also transfer snaps (by saving snaps and sending them to respective parties). We had a central account that sent invites to people&rsquo;s accounts, waited for responses from every account, and used computer vision to analyze the snaps sent by users. OpenCV was used to analyze whether or not a user replied with an acceptance of the game (&ldquo;##CONFIRM&rdquo;). Once all players have accepted, our server randomly selects a player from the list to be the judge. The judge receives a snapchat from our central account that tells it to relax until further instructions, while all other players receive a snap of a black card (prompt card). The users who received prompt cards are then to snap back a response to our central account. The central account then randomly forwards the images to the judge, and based on the judge&rsquo;s answer (which he/she snaps back to our central account), the winning player is notified. The next round starts and another judge is picked.<br><br>

                            In order to make the Piairno work, we used native libraries of the Arduino Unos to produce sounds that matched Piano notes. We matched the tone() command at various frequencies in order to produce the seven notes. Once we had the notes ready, we looked into the flex sensors and their functionality. Accelerometers and gyroscopes were also looked into, but were not implemented in time for the hackathon. For the flex sensors, we set a certain threshold in the middle for it to activate a respective tone. Once all the sensors were hooked up and soldered correctly, we sewed the sensors onto gloves. Since the arduinos needed to be present for the processing of tones, we also sewed the Arduino Unos to each respective glove.<br><br>

                            Ezzy World isn&rsquo;t that technically challenging. However, it is a project that I created from scratch in my early stages of learning how to program. All of the animations you see are drawn using Adobe Illustrator and a Bamboo tablet. The motions of the animations are created by switching two files back and forth to create movement within the game.<br><br>
                            <i>Used Adobe Illustrator in order to manipulate vectors easily to create the animations</i><br>
                            <img src="pages/projects/img/Ezzy.6.png"><br><br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-content_load2s">
                            The project uses Object Oriented Programming in Python in order to keep track of 3 main classes: <br>(1) The Tkinter application that runs the game and the overall logic of the game [for example: the player&rsquo;s money, a list of instances of Ezzies, etc.], <br>(2) Furniture [each furniture object kept track of its own coordinates], <br>(3) Ezzies [which tracked coordinates, health statuses, name, etc.]
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-content_load2s">
                            In order to set up autonomy with the Ezzies, the Python Random library was heavily used. A lot of the logic that went behind an Ezzy moving on its own, or performing actions on its own came from a simple &ldquo;random.randint(low, high)&rdquo; command. The program would check every few seconds or so whether or not the returned random value from random.randint equaled 0. Meaning if random.randint(0, 20) was used, there was a 1 out of 20 chance that an action would be &ldquo;autonomously&rdquo; done. This randomization came into play in the movement of Ezzies, whether or not an Ezzy completed an action with a furniture object in the room, and even in the &ldquo;Get Twerk&rdquo; mini-game where randomly generated strings were produced.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-content_load2s">
                            Other features of Ezzy World includes loading/saving, Ezzies aging over time, Ezzies dying if not treated properly, Ezzies changing animations if dissatisfied, etc. The project was created over a month&rsquo;s span, and was a great experience in terms of learning how to design/implement a full-stack project.
