One thing I must confess is that I watched HTGAWM season finale with Josh this past weekend and pretended to have not seen it with Julide. Of course I sat with her and rewatched the episode, pretending to not have known exactly what will happen. Am I going to hell for this?</p>

                        <p>I spent today feeling pretty awful. I spent about 8 hours on cog. psych homework because I couldn't focus. My body temperature was internally freezing, and my mind was constantly thinking about that. It was a sad day. But I decided to call it quits at about 7 PM and headed to bed the earliest I've ever headed to bed. Slept for about 4 hours, waking up at about 11 PM, and proceeded to go to Gates to finish the work that I couldn't finish earlier in the day due to how crappy I felt. Now I'm sitting here in the Comp Bio room and about to start on architecture readings. Yay for being at CMU. (Sarcasm right there <--)</p>

                        <p>I still seem to have trouble accepting the fact that Nick and Andres aren't the friends who I thought they were. And although nothing is really how I imagine it to be, nor do they really have to be... I can't help but to be bummed/disappointed by them alot. I think it's from the idea of me expecting more from them (friendship wise), but that they are pretty content with things in their lives and don't really want the same.</p>
                        <p>I wish my friends at home were here.... I wish we were on that comfort level of sharing and accomodating and in general, caring.</p>

                        <p>I think the only memorable thing about today was my talk with Ashwini. We sat there on 7th Hillman and talked for about an hour (I actually don't know how long) and got to know each other a bit better. I feel that we are both on similar levels for a lot of things. For example, academics I think are constant struggles for the both of us. She is, however, different from me in the sense that she is ridiculously nice and blatantly innocent. Me on the otherhand, I'm not so blatantly innocent, but perhaps am innocent at heart. She's a cool person who I hope to see more of and get to know more about!</p>

                        <p>I tried to take 2 naps today in the middle of the day. One of them was right before an exam so I can understand why I didn't sleep well, but for 2 hours of my time later that afternoon, I also couldn't sleep well for a perfectly normal nap. I don't know man, maybe it's because I'm not dead tired all of the time anymore, which in my opinion is a great thing. But other than that, it's sort of concerning that I don't get to joyfully nap as I please anymore</p>

                        <p>It's my "first day back" in Pittsburgh since spring break and I have to say that my motivation levels are quite low right now. I'm not feeling the academics here, the friendships here, and overall the atmosphere here. It feels just like me waiting for the next 2 months to pass by so that I can bounce out of this environment rather than me enjoying it thorughly. I appreciate some of the friendships here, but I'd say overall I still feel awkward for some reason.</p>

                        <p>I'll never understand the mechanics and beauty that goes into building airplanes and making them fly. Think about it... Most planes house about 200 passengers + carry-on luggage by most people + mechanical components that make the plane power up and function properly. How much weight that is exactly I'm not entirely sure... But if a car is a ton, then what would an airplane be? How many tons would that be? Now think of the fact that the plane has to FLY. Cars do well on the ground, but they don't have to worry about take-off. But planes man... they somehow soar through the winds without support (except obviously electrical and gas power). It's amazing.... and I think me not being able to fully understand how beautiful a computer is crafted has caused me to appreciate all of the technologies around me.</p>

                        <p>Today was my last full day in Florida for awhile. I went to Hard Rock Cafe for a $50 buffet. LEMME REPEAT THAT FRIEND: FIFTY DOLLARS PER PERSON BUFFET. I think my mom has ridiculously great friends and I'm genuinely glad they've been there for her when I've been off to college. Afterwards I took a nice solo drive through Tampa and back home, and followed it up by watching Zootopia with Steve and Jimmy. I know that this movie wasn't really their type of thing, but the willingness of them to come out tonight to watch a movie was very nice of them. I think they both did it to sort of see me before I left Florida, and to have friends like that to come back to is something that I don't take lightly.</p>

                        <p>Came home from Gainesville today and said my goodbyes to friends. I won't see these people (including my brother) for another few months unfortunately. I'll talk to them still which is pretty dope (shoutout to you technology), but I won't physically see or touch them for at least 2 more months. Perhaps I'll come and visit in those two weeks in May when I'm back, but no promises till I find out what is happening in terms of Microsoft.</p>
                        <p>I wanted to kind of talk about goodbyes today, and by talk about it I sort of just wanted to note how weird goodbyes are. In my 19 years of life, I've said alot of goodbyes, and have seen alot of happy hellos. I don't think I'll ever be able to get used to them though... the idea of saying goodbye never feels like enough. It's not to be able to convey to the other party how ridiculously sad you'll be when you don't see them for weeks, months, or even years. If you're good at communicating, you'll still talk to these people, but if not... you sort of drift apart and when you say goodbye, it's the last thing you kind of say to them. These people who were important to you at once, or even right now... but people who you won't necessarily see. I'm thinking back to my days with that Chinese summer camp right now, and it's kind of bumming me out how our goodbyes were actually goodbyes...</p>

                        <p>Hit up Gainesville today. I was able to see Robin, Janette, Jimmy, John, Timmy, and Jackson in this short 24-hour trip. But it's always nice to see these people and spend time with them. We spent the majority of the time playing Super Smash Bros on the Wii U, and I have to say that it's a nice break from what I normally do. I haven't play smash bros in such a long time (for prolonged periods of course), and it brought back quite a good amount of memories. We used to pack up our Gamecube (which later was actually the first generation of the Nintendo Wii) in this red blanket and put it in a rolly backpack to parties. I remember bringing it to anywhere that had televisions. These were old TVs too, none with HDMIs and just about all of them were as big as an unhuggable box. We would play SSB the majority of times, but would venture to other games occasionally. But it was the only game that brought people from all over to a single sitting staring at one screen. Now they have a bunch of new champions and I have no idea how time passed by so quickly.</p>

                        <p>Early morning Sunday (really Saturday night), John and I stayed up talking about God. I think he's definitely the only person (aside from myself) who would be able to get me to believe. I still want to say that I have a lot of questions and concerns and that I'm not fully on board yet, but I want to also say that I'm not giving up, nor would I probably ever give up. Religion has made John a happy man, and I don't think I could ever be happier for him. But the idea of creation, yet a doom for not believing is a concept I find ridiculously hard to come to terms with. I have some other conflicts with believing in the gospel, but I want to fully accumulate them and list them out before just blabbing on... So, TODO: Talk about religion.</p>
                        <p>On a less serious note, dude I had a $25 brunch buffet in Clearwater today and it was quite lit. Honestly I love and miss food. It's nice to be back to freely eat what I want (and eat GOOD ASS FOOD), and also sleep whenever the fudge I want (a.k.a. take a 3 hour nap from 3PM to 6PM).</p>

                    <h3>March 5, 2016 - Saturday</h3>
                    <p>[1] I believe I just had my first "conflict" with a friend. It wasn't just any friend too, it was Andres. I actually felt kind of hurt how he handled the situation, but I was also at fault for pissing him off. It was a minor setback for us and it dealt with me teasing him about him and Nick. I took it too far, but he also bailed on plans of ours in a pretty rude way. We talked it out online since I was leaving for Florida, and it seems that things are alright now. I don't think I've ever felt bad about something in regards to a relationship except for this time... which is quite odd in my opinion since I'm 19 years old, but I think it really points out how much I care for him and how I don't want to be the one that ruins our relationship.</p>
                    <p>[2] Aside from that overshadowing my whole night, traveling to the airport and chilling there was actually pretty nice. I didn't know Ashwini and Yong were both catching the earliest 28X as well, but we were able to meet each other at the bus stop. I then spent my time waiting for my flight in the Pittsburgh airport with Nupur (who happened to be on the same flight as Ashwini) and Ashwini talking about silly things. Exhaustion/tiredness + great company was ridiculously nice to get my mind off of [1]. After I left for my flight, things got pretty normal. But then when I arrived back in Florida, I was greeted by 5 awesome friends who came to pick me up. Jimmy first and foremost who always somehow agrees to drive an hour+ to pick me up, Steve who tags along (but secretly loves our friendship), Janette (who I don't give enough credit to as a good friend), Robin (who is reasonably awesome), and of course one of my best friends Josh (no comment) were there to not only hang with each other, but also willing to come pick me up. I don't know why but that feeling of being greeted by friends even though you aren't always there for them (i.e. Skype nights) is something that I think I need to be more greatful for. After eating lunch and froyo, I went home to see my mommy and brother :)! We ate hotpot for dinner and man was it night to spend family time. I wanna say, however, that at one point I was pretty mean to my mom for being a mom. John had to remind me to be nicer and that's something I think I need to definitely work on. I get a week here, and man should I take that time wisely.</p>
                    <p>[3] Josh and Julide hopped on google hangouts with me for about an hour. We talked briefly about rules to life and Josh gave us some tips: <br><br>1. Love yourself - an important concept that is easier said than done.<br> 2. Fuck those flaky bitches - people who you put in the effort to try and get to know / help / be kind to but don't reciprocate may not be worth it fam. <br> 3. Never eva eva eva ever give all of yourself to someone else - similar to the rule 2, but really it's also about number 1 and knowing that you are important, and if someone who you've given your all to isn't for you as you are for them, then at least be there for yourself in the end <br> 4. Bless up - keep yourself grounded and appreciate the little things; as silly as DJ Khaled is, I'd say that this is actually something that will lead you to the key to success <br> 5. Never be content with the dumb shit in your life - always strive to take advantage of the opportunites out there, don't just sit around and wait for them to come to you. Go Do.</p>

I understand that people might see the message and intend to return to it later, but end up forgetting along the way, however, if this is a common occurrence, it seems like your communication skills just suck.

                    <p>Today was pretty mediocre... but it's kind of like the calm before the storm. Spring break is coming soon and I can't be anymore excited about it. Being able to see some friends back home will be fun, but also just returning to my old life will be relaxing. That means chillin with my mom, seeing John, and Publix man... Publix ;) Literally going to the mall or the beach or anywhere by car is something that I always seem to miss, but will be able to experience again for about a week.</p>
                    <p>I'm beyond excited to see Jimmy, Steve, Robin, Janette, and Josh when I get back to Florida. I think seeing them first will be a bit odd because I haven't yet seen my mom or John, but getting food and Escape Room will hopefully be a lot of fun!</p>

                    <p>Kevin signed the lease today, meaning all we have to do is get out parents to sign and then we're solid! Getting this place seems quite surreal in my opinion, but I have this internal fear that it'll be extremely expensive and I'll regret signing onto this for 12 months. Who knows if that'll be true, but I certainly know that living in an actual luxury apartment is something I'll have to personally get used to and somehow accept that I'm good enough for.</p>

                    <h3>February 29, 2016 - Monday</h3>
                    <p>Every 4 years, I have the privilege of wishing Kealana Jackson happy birthday. Happy Birthday Kealana. Stay young my friend.</p>
                    <p>I attended a seminar today entitled "Poetic Humanism," and it was given by this published author who has written a few novels about humanistic ideas. She talked about issues such as atheism, but also on the importance of poetic language (which brought me back to my AP Lit and Lang days). Most of her talk was thought-provoking, but there was this particular segment that caught me off-guard and really resonated with me. She talked about factual evidences of why someone like me (or anyone really on Earth) is quite insignificant on the time-space spectrum. She went on and on about how everything has been here for billions of years, and how humans have only been here for about 20000 of those years. She continued with spacial reasonings on how the galaxies are unmindfully monumental, and how the stars we can't unfathomably imagine fully are countless, and how we on Earth make up only a miniscule percentage of a single star. And she asked the question, "do you think you're important?" I remember listening to this... and simply tearing up. I don't fully know why, but I simply know that what she said made me feel something odd and unnoticed by me on a typical day.</p>
                    <p>Moral of that long paragraph... You are important</p>

                    <h3>February 28, 2016 - Sunday</h3>
                    <p>Let's talk politics. I feel like I always talk about my social life and school life... which is great and all cause this is sort of supposed to be a journal of mine, but really let's get down and dirty with what really matters. With the presidential election of 2016 coming up, I'm scared to know what our future holds if we have President Trump in office. I don't know too much about politics, but I know for sure that what Trump does and how he acts is ridiculously inappropriate for presidency.</p>
                    <p>When I see all these media clips about Trump and what he says, it actually makes me question the people of America. I feel like he's still doing this to laugh at how dumb some people can be, but now I'm starting to believe that he is actually just a bad human being. I don't know who i'd vote for, IF i could even vote. When it comes down to it, I enjoy Bernie's social and political views, but not much on his economic beliefs. When you think of socialism, you think of equality and treatment of people nicely... although alot of what he wants is idealistic, it's not very practical. I do wish money could be given to people, but I also know how hard people work to get where they are sometimes. Clinton on the other hand is kind of an odd ball... At one side she seems like she has alot of experience and would be the best choice out of all these candidates... but on the other hand, she's shady af.</p>
                    <p>I'm somewhat glad I'm Canadian... Because if things go south here... welp, Canada it is my friends.</p>

                    <p>It's odd how I don't think I'm worthy of being remembered alot of times... Dimitri from the 7th floor of Hillman [doing research in ML] stopped by my table today to ask me how I was doing. To be completely honest, I didn't think he would remember me. I returned his ID card (which I found in the elevator) one night over Thanksgiving break and for some reason, he was able to recognize my face when he passed by. We saw each other occasionally throughout this year since that encounter, but we always just smiled and passed by. But it was kind of nice to know that he now knows my name and is able to recognize my face.</p>

                    <p>It's always nice to be able to come back to the Skype crew... or should I say Discord crew now? I'm talking Jimmy, Steve, Robin, and Janette (Oh, and occasionally Kealana). I think there are alot of unstable relationships (somewhat unstable at least) in my life, or at least how I perceive them. So everytime I return to these four, it's a pleasure to be welcomed back with open arms. Janette even bought me a $30 game, which I'll probably play a total of 4 times before I dispose of it under my load of work.</p>
                    <p>I give them alot of crap sometimes with Josh, complaining sort of how they are living their lives. And I think I'm just a jerk at those times because their lives aren't mine to live. And if they're happy... I'm happy. Thanks pals for being real.</p>

                    <h3>February 25, 2016 - Thursday</h3>
                    <p>I had the honor of eating lunch with a friend of mine on Tuesday and wanted to sort of reflect on how appreciative I am of her as a person. Isabel Bleimeister (E-tower, my floor) and I met orientation week. I was pretty desparate to find some friends at first and was willing to talk to anyone. The great thing about talking to some people was that they were just as willing to talk to me, and they weren't intimidating. Isabel was one of those people.</p>
                    <p>She made eye contact with me, smiled whenever I said something, and always seemed to have some kind of intellectual response to what I said. I remeber kayaking with her, yet thinking that she was somewhat of a dull person. As time progressed, she relaxed a bit more in terms of laughing at my dumb jokes, and we started to have this mutual respect that I typically don't find evident in alot of other people. I no longer found her being "dull" a bad thing at all, and in fact found respect out of that aspect of her.</p>
                    <p>So what made me really respect her wasn't necessarily just how she's a kind person when you speak to her (she really REALLY listens to you), but how she maintains a very mild lifestyle and is completely uninfluenced by societal pressures to change her personality/interests. She sleeps early (I'm talking like 10 PM) when she can [although CMU got her sleeping after 12 AM], and ALWAYS wakes up early (around 6 - 8 AM sometime). She reads books that I have grown to think are some-what teen-like, but in reality, she's able to find beauty in them that I don't think I'm competent enough to accomplish myself.</p>
                    <p>I sat with her last Tuesday on Gates 6th, talking about the usual topics we read about: reading books (Harry Potter mostly), psychology (she's a neuroscience major), and sadness from classes. She has this phone design paper thingy that she made herself with her favorite quotes from books. 3 Harry Potter quotes, 1 Narnia, 1 The Outsiders, etc. She sat there with enthusiasm explaining the significance of each quote and exciting over the little things that they taught her. That, my friend... is why she is a valuable person.</p>
                    <p>For someone to find meaning out of something she enjoys is quite remarkable. She is a prime example of her "doing her own thang." She does it well, and has my utmost support, respect, and love.</p>

                    <h3>February 24, 2016 - Wednesday</h3>
                    <p><b>A post for the sad me:</b></p>
                    <p>Sometimes you feel down. And that's ok. I want you to remember the times you had with your friends. Your awesome, flipping friends. I'm talking about those memories from when you were young and didn't do anything except play videogames with the boys, I'm talking about those trips to Atlanta and around the U.S. (and even to the Bahamas) with that great group of friends, I'm talking about the multiple times where you just sat at Starbucks with Josh and Julide and talked about everything, I'm talking about those nights where you went out to grab unhealthy Checkers with John, and I'm talking about those times where you looked at your friends at CMU and simply smiled.</p>
                    <p>Danielle, there's more to life than you think of at times... In fact, many times you tend to forget about that fact and you focus on something small and stupid. Grades won't matter in the far future, so relax. Relationships will fall in place, and those that don't... weren't really worth keeping were they? I want you to keep being the person you want to be. Someone who's kind to random strangers because darn it, they deserve it. Someone who works hard towards what you want, to make those that have been there for you all your life proud. Someone who knows and trusts in the fact that there's a reason for this, and that you don't have to know what that reason is... you kind of have to just accept it.</p>
                    <p>I've been blessed really to go through the things that I've been through. I've seriously been blessed with Microsoft, a group of friends that have been (mostly just were) supportive and wesome, and parents that agree to Skyvue Apartments. Things may seem really odd right now, but I promise odd doesn't mean bad. You'll live.</p>

                    <h3>February 23, 2016 - Tuesday</h3>
                    <p>So today a 3 BR apartment in Skyvue opened up and we were informed by Jessica. Unfortunately, I don't thin Yong wants to go for that rooming set-up anymore. Even though that would entail him getting his own bedroom, his own kitchen, and a LUXURY APARTMENT, he'd rather choose Morewood Gardens. He'd be paying less that Morewood for sure if we were able to sublet the place for the summer, and most likely that would be the case. But I don't know what changed his heart on this one, and I'd have to say I'm really bummed out by his choice. I definitely would've enjoyed having the three of us room together versus just me and Kevin, but I'm still not complaining cause luxury apartment + balcony is actually quite a dream come true.</p>
                    <p>It's odd how different people want different things. As corny as that sounds, it's something that I have to constantly remind myself to be able to keep an open-mind. I lived through a really crap year living in Gardens, and have really tried to gear Yong away from that lifestyle, but I believe his value in staying on campus is something that I should respect... so I will. Farewell 3BR.</p>

                    <p>You know... I don't really know what I'm doing for one of my classes, and it's scaring me quite a bit. I really just want to pass at this point so that I never have to touch circuits again. Isn't that a sad reality? To want to not fail is my goal here... When really I should aim for B at a minimum to hold my standards to what they were before this place brought me down. DAMMNNNNN DANIELle, you're really repressing me with these posts lately.</p>

                    <p>I'm constantly finding myself bummed out... I think this spring break is a good needed break for sure, but even after that I feel like I'm going to come back to the same deal here. I really need one of those pick'me up strolls around Schenley sometime soon... I'd have to say the whole Frankenfam deal is bringing me down, and it's not really the Frankenfam thing... it's 2 damn particular people who I consider my closest friends here and who I don't feel very close to anymore. There are times that it seems to be fine, but at other times I'm sitting in a pool of loneliness.</p>
                    <p>So here's my plan to feel better: (1) Music + Nature and (2) Good cry sesh. Will update you when I achieve one or both of these.</p>

                    <h3>February 20, 2016 - Saturday</h3>
                    <p><i>Why I wanted a luxury apartment:</i></p>
                    <p>I'm getting closer to actually signing the lease to this thing, although I don't know for sure until I sign and dot it where I'll be living for next year.</p>
                    <p>I supposed I wanted to take some time out of my night to address my reasoning behind spending approximately $1100(+?) a month (for 12 months if we don't find people to sublet to) for somewhere to sleep. But it's not just "somewhere to sleep" for me. In fact, that's the complete opposite of what I want from an apartment. "Somewhere to sleep" is what I have right now, and it's what I had last year too as a freshman. Ever since coming to college, I haven't ever felt as if my home was my room. I haven't felt comfortable staying in that small tiny room and do work, or relax and watch TV, or really do anything execept just sleep.</p>
                    <p>Morewood has been my home for the past two years, and it really hasn't made me feel that way. Instead, living on-campus has sort of just made me feel like school/CMU = home. And when you don't differentiate between the two, I suppose you can grow quite depressed like I do sometimes. I feel as if I don't get a break from school. And that whatever I'm doing in terms of goofing off is wrong because I'm still at school until the end of the year really. So whenever I'm in my room just watching TV, I can't help but to feel extremely guilty. I can't even study in my own room because I feel like I can just go over to "next door" into my office (Gates) and study there. I don't use my bathroom at home except really to shower and get ready for bed, and using that kitchen upstairs/downstairs in Gardens has got to be one of the most dreadful things that I do in Gardens.</p>
                    <p>I don't want that anymore... I want somewhere that makes me feel comfortable. Somewhere that makes me feel like I'm at home. A place where it's nicely crafted, clean, and home-y. I'd take candles and light it up, or make it smell like a specific scent so that everytime I enter, I won't smell garbage from the trashcans down the hall, or whatever that weird musty smell is when I enter our room... It's not bad... but it's certainly not good. I want somewhere to work quietly, and not have to search for places and feel like an ass for taking up a spot where somewhere else can use. I want to be able to use my own bathroom and take care of it so that I don't feel disgusted. I want a bed that I don't have to physically climb up to, nor do I want a bed that makes me feel trapped. I want it to be open so that I can look up and see my room, or perhaps even look out the window at the city (that's probably not going to be the case but that would be pretty dope).</p>
                    <p>I want to be able to go to the kitchen and make myself a snack instead of starving myself or buying a meal and eating it for two. I want to be able to go to the living room and just sit on my couch for no reason at all except to maybe just watch some television. I would love to be able to walk around and feel like I'm at a hotel, or walk around and sit at a randomly open area that has nice interior designs.</p>
                    <p>Most of all, I just want a place that feels like home. A place where I know I belong at and don't feel like shit when I don't get invited to things. I want a place that openly and comfortably accepts me and invites me to relax. A place that makes me feel good about staying in my apartment/room. A place that I do more than just sleep in for about 4 hours a night. A place where I take care of and keep clean because I know exactly what's been where and who did that. A place where I can be in my room alone and cry really is pretty nice too. A place where my friends can visit and call home as well. A place that is me.</p>

                    <h3>February 19, 2016 - Friday</h3>
                    <p>Ended classes and went to Chipotle with Andres today. I really enjoy my time with this kid and I don't know why. He says the dumbest things sometimes, but I've found myself caring for him more than I typically care about people. He opened up to me about his family and some serious stuff about his parents (father and his coma, parents' divorce, etc.), which made me appreciate his openess to me.</p>
                    <p>I feel like when we do have time to converse alone, we tend to talk about some serious things. And him opening up to me about his family is something I really appreciate, and have always wanted from someone at CMU. I want to return the favor sometime by also opening up about my life, but I don't know what to say most of the times. If I can't do that, I think I want to at least express this thankfulness for his willingness to open up. I believe he tells me more things than most people here (aside from Nick of course :P), which makes me wonder how I was able to gain his trust like this.</p>
                    <p>We later went to see Deadpool with some Loaf Fam peeps + Tanvi and Anagha(SP?). I remember struggling earlier in the year with feeling left out of these social events and being really down about them, but I'm genuinely glad Tanvi invited me and the other members of the fam for tonight. It's nice to literally forget about the stresses that is CMU.</p>
                    <p>Also... I e-mailed Steven Dow today and asked him for a recommendation letter to attach to my application for HCII's double major program. He and Amy both agreed to help me out which is awesome! I think these recommendations will be a tremendous help and compensate for my GPA. I don't know if I'll get in the program yet, and I certainly don't want to assume that because I have a reference, I am guaranteed this position. I'll continue to work hard and try to be a model HCI student in the meantime, but YESSSSS in terms of being able to win the love of these 2 awesome HCI members.</p>

                    <h3>February 18, 2016 - Thursday</h3>
                    <p>It's official-ish!...Almost? I went to the leasing office of Skyvue today with Kevin, early in the morning before my 10:30 class. We sat down, looked at a few floor plans, and finally decided on a B10 on the 11th floor. We deposited the $500, securing that plan for us, and turned in applications. What's next is waiting for our parents to complete financial information to make sure we're approved for the place, and then signing the lease making our rooming situations official for the next year.</p>
                    <p>I also had great conversations with a few people today. Nick and I grabbed some dinner (and bubble tea!) after attempting to be productive, and ended up talking about the typical stuff that we normally talk about. Things that ranged from how movies were cinematographically shot and crafted, to our high school friends and their lives now. Later in the night, I was able to talk to Josh and Julide over G Hangouts. We caught up, made hilarious jokes, and for those 3 hours, I genuinely forgot about my problems in the world. It was great finding out that Julide will be spending her summer in Morocco. DID YOU HEAR ME? MOROCCO! Then when Julide peaced out, Josh and I actually got pretty personal and I told him about my situation with Can & Chrissy, which I don't think I've ever told anyone outside of my family.</p>
                    <p>I want to stress on today as a great day versus last Tuesday. Housing seems to be under the belt (relatively) for now, and friendships seem to be going pretty strong. It's great to be alive.</p>

                    <p>So Yong officially dropped out of our roommate situation and decided to stay on campus living in Morewood. I feel like he doesn't know what he's getting into, but I can only hope that he'll be happy next year. That leaves me and Kevin to most likely just go with a 2BR in Skyvue which is pretty OK with me. I'm still really bummed out about the living situation, but hopefully things will turn out alright.</p>
                    <p>Had a great talk with Nick last night for a few hours. I really do enjoy having those moments with him where it's just us talking about whatever. Alot of times it goes into technical details, but mostly it's just us and how we feel about things. I appreciate our friendship, and really hope nothing changes next year due to the distance of our living situations.</p>

                    <h3>February 16, 2016 - Tuesday</h3>
                    <p>Remember when I said there's like a 95% chance of us living there? Well believe it or now, that 5% chance happened. I think today has legit been the worst day that I've had this whole entire school year. I had 3 exams today, and all 3 of them I don't feel completely confident in. In fact, I KNOW that at least 2/3 exams went pretty roughly. I can't really help that though in my opinion. Having to jam all that information for each exam was quite rough, but it couldn't be helped cause welp, my life sucks right now.</p>
                    <p>So back to housing... Apparently ALL of the 3 bedroom units were taken up this morning. Meaning that legitimately from yesterday's call up till now, people decided to go for it and conveniently cheat us out of a place. I literally hate this timing since I always believed in the idea that bad things happen to me... literally anything bad that can happen will happen to me. And this is why when Microsoft offered me that final interview, I definitely didn't believe in myself. I didn't think that such a good thing good happen, but it did! So I stopped believing in that for awhile, but look at today. It's literally a prime example of me getting my hopes up and then being let down.</p>
                    <p>Maybe this is for the better. Maybe me getting a luxury apartment was a bit more expensive than I really needed, and maybe going somewhere else is actually better. We'll see how things turn out. Right now we're looking into a place called Sherwood Towers for housing. It has 3BR/2BT set-up like Skyvue, but it's definitely not as new and nice. Another option is Webster, but I just genuinely feel disappointed right now. Like RIDICULOUSLY disappointed. Maybe living with Yong and Kevin would make me feel better, or maybe I should just go to a solo place and get a studio? i don't know... but life sucks.</p>

With 2 of my close friends and my own flipping room + bathroom! I get to experience this living situation with these two awesome close friends, meaning we'll be grocery shopping together, cooking together, buying furniture together, crying and installing Ikea furniture together, etc.</p>
                    <p>Plus did I mention LUXURY APARTMENT?! No more shitty living situations and disgust! I literally don't have to worry about that weird thing in my bathroom sink because I'll have cleaned everything weird about that sink if it becomes dirty! I'll be able to make my bed every morning and be that person that I was 2 years ago (lol). I'll have my own desk and quiet quarters to study and be myself. I'll be able to Skype Steve and Jimmy when they call me salty now. I'll be able to literally walk across the hall and ask the two of them if they want to hang because these two are people who I genuinely find awesome to hang with. Also a plus is no shoes in the apartment so it'll feel like an actual home instead of a dorm!</p>
                    <p>I want to express here (but maybe to them) how thankful I am to Kevin and Yong for actually making my dreams come true :P. I don't know if I would've gotten a studio in Morrow Park, meaning I probably wouldn't have been getting a place that has a nice new feeling to it. The views will hopefully be nice in the apartment, and best of all, that kitchen better be my second home because I plan on utilizing that kitchen like I do at home, BUT EVEN MORE!</p>

                    <h3>February 14, 2016 - Sunday</h3>
                    <p>Two topics for today: one's an update on Project Ignite, and the other is a random thought I had while microwaving my dinner and looking outside...</p>
                    <p>[1] Project Ignite is going pretty darn well! I can't really say that is the definitive case for how Allie and Eric feel about us because I'm pretty sure they slightly hate us. With good reasoning, however... Kevin and I suck at communicating AND we're always late... So it's totally cool if they hate us (we don't blame them). Our 6 students, however, I believe really enjoy the experience. The only person I'd say is pretty bored is Stephen, and that's simply because he has literally done just about everything that we teach these students. I want to express how appreciative I am for how chill they are. I enjoy their enthusiasm and spirits in this venture that we're currently exploring for the first time. I think Kevin is an awesome partner as well and I'm so glad he doesn't hate me for sometimes not doing anything. More updates to come on the upcoming 5 sessions for Project Ignite.</p>
                    <p>[2] Distance. More specifically, vertical distancing from the ground. I noticed today how conditioned I am with heights now. Coming from Florida, I literally got excited looking out the window of 3rd story buildings in high school. But I now look down 9-storied buildings without much feeling. I feel like that that's not really a good thing... I enjoyed being wow'ed by 'skyscrapers' and tall views. Although I experienced some of that when I visited NYC and China, I can't help but to feel less impressed with the whole 'view/height' thing now that I normally come to Gates for a nice work spot. This may literally be just me conditioned to see the same old scene, and not actually something about heights, but I think it's worth mentioning because I surely want to keep note of how my experiences and views of this world change after going to a school in a completely different state.</p>

                    <h3>February 13, 2016 - Saturday</h3>
                    <p>Studying for midterms today (woke up at a gross hour for this to try and compensate for yesterday's lack of studying), but I guess an interesting thing I have been thinking about recently is how you define 'home.' So I'll talk about this more interesting note instead of 240.</p>
                    <p>Home... Right now I define it to be where I lived for over 10 years. It's where I remember the majority of my life as of right now, and it's where I associate with family. My mom still lives there for now, but after this summer, I don't know who will live in that house, and she as well as my dad will be somewhere in northern California.</p>
                    <p>I often say 'home' here at CMU when I refer to my dorm room, but it never <i>feels</i> like home. It feels like a tiny room where I can sleep for approximately 4 hours every night (6 hours on weekends) and shower/freshen up to not feel super bum-like. The other 20 hours of the day I spend 'on-campus', which really means across the street of Forbes. Probably 60% of that time is spent in Gates and the other 40% is spent in classrooms.</p>
                    <p>CMU has never felt like 'home' to me. And I'm not sure it ever will. It's 'school'. It's 'work'. It's where I go to become a smarter and more impressive individual, not where I go to relax and feel at ease. The main reason why I am pursuing a 'luxury apartment' is because I feel a void in my life right now. An anchor where I can call home here in Pittsburgh. Spending about 8 months out of the year in some place where you don't consider home is pretty exhausting. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I want to be able to separate my school life and home life some more. To be able to enjoy myself and not feel like I'm at school 24/7. I also want to have a clean and nice set-up so that I don't live in disgust. Currently Gardens holds that status in my eyes. There's dust and crap on the floor, the bathroom is never as clean as I would like it to be, my fridge is always empty or containing left-overs, and the space there is so crowded / uncomfortable that I genuinely can not stand a full day in that room.</p>
                    <p>I want to be able to go home, go to my own room, and simply be alone. That's what I want.</p>

                    <h3>February 12, 2016 - Friday</h3>
                    <p>I tried to go see Deadpool tonight, but tickets were sold out :(. We ended up watching Pride and Prejudice and Zombies instead... Pretty alright movie actually, but it was super weird and under any other circumstance, I definitely would have not watched it. But I actually kind of enjoyed the movie, although I didn't really find a point to it, AND it ended on a note that made me question the intent and purpose of this 'remake'.</p>
                    <p>I also went to get some official floor plans from Skyvue today which was pretty exciting. The pricing of it all seems quite feasible as of right now, but I don't want to feel confident about my living situation next year until we officially signed the lease.</p>

                    <h3>February 11, 2016 - Thursday</h3>
                    <p>I feel like I have a decent shot at getting into the double major program for HCI here at CMU. I talked to the head of the undergraduate program and he seemed definitely surprised when I mentioned Steven Dow. I really hope that I can formulate a professional and convincing e-mail to ask Steven if he would be willing to recommend me for the program. I can't think of a reason for not writing me a letter aside from the simple argument that he has a busy life, but hopefully he can make the time to help me out.</p>
                    <p>I'm fairly confident that I would enjoy my life more in HCI classes and projects than the typical ECE stressful-as-fuck classes that I am currently taking (and very much not interested in). But I believe the topics he covered today were definitely a good indicator that I do have a change and belong in this department. HOPEFULLY, (1) I can get that letter of recommendation, and (2) I can not fail my upcoming midterms s.t. I'll have a decent grade for mid-semester grades (aka no Cs or lower).</p>

                    <p>I feel like I am continually disappointed by some people/things that I really shouldn't be. Maybe I handle these issues a bit better than others, but I am definitely no super-human who never gets sad. Sometimes I just get the feels man...</p>

                    <p>John got into Minesota's Pharmacy school today! Can you believe my big brother? He's actually not doing bad at all for the amount of work he puts in versus me. I'd say that he's most definitely a role model to me. Even though he may be lazy, he's getting by very well with minimal/moderate effort.</p>
                    <p>Today Andres also opened up to me about some issues he was having in his life. These things ranged from his roommate troubles, all the way to his issues with Nick. Although I'm bummed he has these issues on top of his work life right now, I genuinely enjoyed talking out his problems with him today. I definitely consider him my best friend here so I'm glad to be there for someone I care alot about.... Was this too corny? Meh.</p>

                    <h3>February 8, 2016 - Monday</h3>
                    <p>So I went and saw Morrow Park Apartments today with Kevin. Must I say... it was perfect. I think if a studio apartment was open at the time (and the waitlist situation wasn't that iffy), I'd definitely have applied today upfront. But because there is that waitlist situation, I might actually look to a place called Skyvue. Although I for some reason still feel like my heart belongs to Morrow Park, I think it might change when/if I go to Skyvue... Mainly because of the VUE man.</p>
                    <p>I think Kevin and I are convincing ourselves that this costs about the same as an on campus housing sitatuion at CMU, but in reality I feel like it'll be a lot more. Although this doesn't seem to be a major issue, it does beg the question if I'm being selfish. I feel like I deserve to have a break with school and to finally live in a comforatable and enjoyable place. But I also feel like I could've had that living in a place like Amberson or Kennilworth.
                    </p>
                    <p>I think I'm a little conflicted as of right now in terms of what I should do, but I'm pretty confident that my heart wants to go to a luxury apartment styled place. Skyvue is being finished this July, meaning we'd be the first residents in this area. It's so close to the Pitt campus and Carlow University campus that I feel like in future years, this place will indeed have a giant waitlist situation.</p>
                    <p>I'm not sure if this is worth... but I definitely feel like my future job security is convincing me to just go with it. It'll cost a good amount, but it'll surely be appreciated by my tummy and my comforts.</p>

                    <h3>February 7, 2016 - Sunday</h3>
                    <p>Saturday night (after my entry in this blog), I had the privilege to attend dinner with Tanvi and her family. It was similar to last year's dinner party, except this time I definitely felt closer (and less awkward) with the people there. I definitely knew Tanvi more, but also Yong and Nick as well. Andres, Emily, Kanisha, and Ashwini were also there (newbies lol).</p>
                    <p>I hope this becomes a yearly thing because eating at The Porch with some good company is always a nice break. More than that, I think, is seeing Tanvi's parents interact with students. I think they're both very amicable and sociable. They're interactions throughout the night make me really miss my parents, although I feel as if this type of dinner would not be pulled off well if they came into town. (Only saying that because of the language barrier).</p>
                    <p>That serious FOMO I felt days before was cured that day with a text inviting me to dinner by Tanvi. I'm genuinely glad she invited me (and thought of me really) because I thoroughly enjoyed the company and the noms.</p>

                    <h3>February 6, 2016 - Saturday</h3>
                    <p>Updates on my life right now: I have 3 midterms on one day coming up, I'm currently waitlisted for the dream apartment that I want, and I think my parents are now going to be residents of Oakland, California now.</p>
                    <p>Let's start with the midterms... Wowzers will I be stressed the upcoming weekend. I'll have to study a crap ton for 2 of the exams and then I'll have to read a bunch for the other. I'm a little stressed out right now, but I don't think I've fully accepted the urgency of this issue as of right now.</p>
                    <p>Waitlisted is pretty unfortunate... I don't know if I should continue to pursue this nice luxury apartment, or if I should just go ahead and settle for somewhere like Amberson (or maybe Kennilworth still?). I hope that the list somehow shortens or that I'm able to get a 2B2B / studio apartment for the next two years. But knowing my luck, it'll be August or so and I'll have literally nowhere to live. I think this news is really bumming me out, but maybe when I visit on Monday it'll be as if I don't actually want this place that badly and I'll eventually just settle at a place like Amberson.</p>
                    <p>Last news is pretty good news I think! My dad officially accepted a full-time position in California so I believe my mom will move there sometime this summer. I'm excited that they'll be together again (since I feel bad for both of them for being so lonely). I do feel that this is a little odd though... It may mean that I won't go back "home" to Florida for a very long time after this summer ends. It may indeed mean that I won't see my friends from Florida for prolonged periods (even longer than the 5 months that I'm used to between school breaks). </p>
                    <p>I also think it's a little odd to feel as if my new "home" is somewhere on a completely different side of the U.S. I'm really hoping that either (1) John goes to school in Gainsville again for a few more years, that way I'll simply visit him on breaks and catch up with friends. Or (2) I find a comfortable home here in Pittsburgh where I actually consider it a place I would like to stay at during those confusing break periods.</p>

                    <h3>February 5, 2016 - Friday</h3>
                    <p>Concluding the wellness week posts is the topic of fresh air. I thoroughly believe that getting a breath of fresh air and some green nature in your system is a necessity to a healthy mental mind.</p>
                    <p>Hiking, camping, and anything that really puts you out in the nature with yourself (& perhaps family) is something remarkable. It re-energizes you and puts perspective to life. Life isn't just about your job, your school, your financial/economic/political/social standings... it's about being alive and having the ability to expand and contract those lungs of yours. A simple statement, yet powerful.</p>
                    <p>I used to take walks in a local park in high school. When I was a junior and senior, I would come home alone before my parents did. I had time to take the car to this park and simply walk around. The familiar settings of tall pine trees and that smell of the forrest encapsulating your everything pivots your attention to the simple things in life that you often forget to appreciate.</p>
                    <p>When I was faced with 10 college rejections, I would go out to these parks and simply relax. I thought that the forrest was there to make it a scenic celebration of acceptances, but in reality it was there to help me find solace. I can't really express fully how nature has helped me in life. It's something you should simply experience.</p>
                    <p>So I encourage you to take the scenic route by foot next time you're around. To find a place where you can go to when you need a break.</p>

                    <h3>February 4, 2016 - Thursday</h3>
                    <p>Food and yums. Not only do they serve a greater purpose for your body, but it's also enjoyable many of the times! Food is great, I'm telling you. They taste delicious on your taste buds, and they simply make you a less groggy person.</p>
                    <p>Lately, however (and by lately I mean college), it's hard to find not only the time to eat healthy, but also the effort. For me, living in Morewood Gardens my sophomore year and not having a meal plan has been kind of a struggle. I want to eat healthy, but I'm also pretty lazy. Lazy to get groceries because I simply need to take an hour and a half minimum to get those, lazy to drag up bags full of groceries, and lazy to put these produce into the mini-fridge that is shared between both my roommate and me.</p>
                    <p>When I want to cook, it's also a flipping struggle. I sometimes feel great and willing to go cook, but most of the times, I don't want to have to go up to a public kitchen and cook in a not-so-welcoming setting. I always have to take the time to check upstairs/downstairs for a free kitchen, and then when I'm there cooking, I always feel paranoid that someone will come in on my cooking time and judge me harshly for not being the Gordon Ramsey of CMU.</p>
                    <p>Simply loading the pots/pans/equipment to cook is a pain. I have this old box with oil stains on it that I put my cookware and groceries in when I want to cook. I then have to open heavy-ass doors to get to the upper/lower floors for a kitchen that (at that point) may or may not be free. Then, when I want to eat, I have to wash my cookware, pack up my food, and travel downstairs to my own dorm room to eat. Do you not see how much of a pain this is? It's literally the worst.</p>
                    <p>I'd have to say this year without a convenient kitchen has really driven me to want a better living space. Somewhere where I can cook privately (Whatever I want to cook), somewhere where I can move 2 cm to get a spatula (rather than going back downstairs), and somewhere where the kitchen area is clean because I keep it that way. That's all I really want out of life... isn't it?</p>
                    <p>This time has also driven me to want a grocery shop close to my living quarters, so as of right now, I'm seriously looking into this luxury apartment down in Shadyside for my home for the next 2 years. I just think it might be a struggle to feel welcomed by friends after that transision. But honestly, who knows right?</p>

                    <h3>February 3, 2016 - Wednesday</h3>
                    <p>Relationships with people are a must in life. They do indeed keep you sane and healthy up till a certain point. Think about how many times you've been stressed out, hopeless, depressed, etc. Hopefully when you're in a better place now, and hopefully you have an example in mind where someone you knew helped pull you out of that stage in your life.</p>
                    <p>See it's great to hold close relationships to people that you truly care about. I'm talking about your lover, your friend, or even your friendly acquaintance that you see every often. People connecting with each other is something so primitively needed that most of the times it's not truly appreciated.</p>
                    <p>I think reflecting back in my life, I truly believe that my reason for still being happy is because every now and then I'll find these relationships that are truly humbling. I'm talking about just knowing some people and having the privilege of calling these individuals your friend.</p>
                    <p>The best thing about having these relationships is the mere fact that you can learn from these people. Learn their stories, their mistakes, their roots of happiness. Grow from what they know by adapting yourself to what you see best fits. Better relationships equates to better mental health for sure.</p>

                    <h3>February 2, 2016 - Tuesday</h3>
                    <p>I think this week should be a promotion of wellness, and a reflection of how ridiculously unhealthy I am these days. So as mentioned in yesterday's post... I average about 3 hours of sleep each night on weekdays. That's not entirely awful right? I think some people may think it is, but in reality, I was able to stay mostly awake in almost all of my classes.</p>
                    <p>Okay, that's not really that great of an achievement... but it is if you compare my previous track record. My inability to sleep has actually caused me to think that going back home at 4 AM is early. How jank man...</p>
                    <p>I wake up every morning hating myself, and then slowly take the next few minutes - an hour waking up to a steady state of consciousness. The worst part about this lifestyle, however, is the fact that I fall asleep during important lectures / fall asleep on people who don't deserve that kind of disrespect. I promise it's not because I find these people boring or anything, and really it's just about me being sleepy from 3 hours of sleep.</p>
                    <p>I have a bottle full of caffeine pills that I plan to utilize when I get tired now, but hopefully that won't make me die.</p>

I genuinely have no clue if you're still even alive, if Winston is healthy and growing, and if your marriage with Chrissy is still working out. I hope it is. I genuinely do. I hope that you're not living a miserable life and have no one to turn to, and that you are indeed genuinely happy with your family & new life.</p>
                    <p>I think if you truly think this is a better lifestyle, then that's okay with me. I only hope mom and dad can feel that way as well and stop caring as much. But they're your parents so that's never going to be the case... so I can only hope that it doesn't hurt them as much.</p>

                    <p>I think I'm lowkey depressed... I know it's weird to say, mostly because I may not actually be depressed, but I think it's worth mentioning here. It might be because I have felt pretty darn lonely these past 3 weeks back at CMU, but it might also just be because I'm sick and tired of this lifestyle.</p>
                    <p>I had about 3 hours of sleep every night last week.... and again... it's only the 3rd week back. I don't necessarily mind this lifestyle, but I'm certainly starting to get tired of it. I'm starting to question what my purpose in life really is, and why I do the things that I do.</p>
                    <p>My amazing brother, John, got into pharmacy school with such ease and comfort in his life. And although I don't think I can do what he does necessarily, I do believe that his past four years are a lot more enviable than my past 2 years. It begs the question, why am I so stressed out all of the time? Why am I putting my body and health through this when in reality, I can play videogames on my free time, live in a nice apartment with three awesome and close friends, and perhaps the most enviable: be surrounded by people who love each other and certainly show that in their everyday interactions.</p>
                    <p>Maybe the issue here is Loaf Fam... or what it's supposed to be. I suppose when I look around at my other friends and their relationships, I can definitely see joy out of them. But everytime (and it's quite rare) we interact, it seems that our fam isn't actually that great. It's not that we force our friendships, but it doesn't seem like it's a priority at all. I'm guilty this too, and probably the biggest culprit is CMU, but why does it have to be like this?</p>

                    <p>I think relationships with people are quite important. It's important to keep up with those who you find remarkable people. Isabel from my freshman dorm is someone like that. I haven't seen her practically a whole semester, yet I respect the hell out of this woman and her lifestyle. She reads so many books, finds nerdy things awesome, and sleeps (& wakes up) ridiculously early. All traits that seem to escape me.</p>

                    <h3>January 26, 2016 - Tuesday</h3>
                    <p>"FOMO" - <i>fear of missing out</i></p>
                    <p>I remember hearing this slang term from my buddy Josh over this past winter break. <br>"Don't you ever get FOMO?"<br>"What's FOMO?"</p>
                    <p>Tonight, I have FOMO. I shouldn't right? But I guess two people who I considered my really close friends here at CMU were having this conversation at ~1 AM tonight up on Gates 8th floor. I walked up to get some coffee syrup and creamer to find them sitting there. Casually, I walked up and asked how things were going.</p>
                    <p>"Not great, could you please leave?"</p>
                    <p>Boom, FOMO. I guess it's a weird FOMO that people don't normally associate with the word. I imagine FOMO tends to go with events such as being invited to parties and social gatherings. But I guess for me, I consider these two really good friends and feel left out of having these deep conversations about life and personal issues.</p>
                    <p>To me, these conversations are how you ease up with your friends and eventually take them as close best friends. It's when you can let down your guards about personal issues and vulnerabilities and trust that person(s) in front of you with how you feel. I guess I am still looking for these close friends here at CMU to make myself feel more at home here, but I still feel like this is school and home is where I'll eventually be.</p>
                    <p>Yea I'm pretty bummed right now with this FOMO, but not for the reasons that I thought I would be. I hope to meet Josh and Julide one day here, or even just a plain old Angel.</p>

                    <p>For the past two nights, I've been hopping on Skype with my brother, John, and our childhood friend (also John's best friend) Jonathan. John's currently visiting Jonathan for the weekend since he had an interview up where Jonathan lives now. His family moved up to Minnesota about 7 years ago... Can you believe that? They're both literally graduating/graduated from college now...</p>
                    <p>We relived some of our childhood memories by replaying some video games that we used to. I remember those days where it was literally so chill. Now I'm drowning in stress and homework. I don't think I'll regret spending my hours fooling around with them this weekend, but I am definitely going to pull a late night finishing up homework that I should've finished tonight (instead of playing games). It's 3:44 AM (technically this should be a Sunday post) and I still have a good amount of cognitive psychology to go through.</p>

                    <p>Probably shouldn't have done that because I ate snow plenty of times tonight, and my sick body is now internally freezing. Hopefully I'll feel better. But if not? YOLO.</p>

It's a bummer that I won't get a stuffed penguin this year, but I definitely think staying up 36 hours straight to hack is not advised.</p>
                    <p>On the bright side: Today was great though, I found out that my brother got into pharmacy school! He has the awesome option to go to University of Florida for Pharmacy School :) That's pretty awesome if you ask me.</p>

                    <p>Before I start, I want to introduce this new feature to this blog. Everytime I think of something neat to talk/blah about, but already have something to talk about for the day (and don't want to extend the entry tediously long, I'll just write in "important" brackets "TODO: [prompt]". That way, when I get stuck on a particularly boring day, I can just Ctrl-F a TODO and do it. Then I'll edit the entry so that next time I'll just see something like "DONE: [prompt]".</p>
                    <p>TODO: Talk about the importance of connecting with people. Why you do it, what you benefit from it, etc. In particular, your days at the Hospice with Don and Jennifer (and Ken), as well as Berry from Gates.</p>
                    <p>ACTUAL ENTRY: Okay, so today was great! It was the first day of Project Ignite. Kevin and I were able to meet up with the 6 high school students who seemed interested in programming/quadrotors. We were able to spend the 3 hours today fully so that's always a good sign. But to be completely honest, I'm very frightened for the future sessions. Kevin and I have absolutely nothing planned/working. We are still working on getting it to fly normally, let alone program it to fly.</p>
                    <p>Hopefully, Kevin will be able to use his awesome research experience to save our booties. Meeting the 6 high schoolers today (who I genuinely thought were awesome for their age) was quite a surreal experience. Here sat individuals who came to LEARN something from ME. But what do I know honestly? Not sure... I'll figure it out probably? Or it'll just be a sad and embarassing experience for Kev and I. I definitely think meeting them was a good idea. Now I'll start taking Quad Academy seriously... which I should've done a long time ago.</p>

                    <h3>January 16, 2016 - Saturday</h3>
                    <p>Today, I'm going to talk about <i>99% Invisible</i>, a neat little podcast about design that I recently discovered. If you looked into my interests page "(stuff I find swell"), you'd know that "Design" is something I certainly fancy. I discovered this guy Roman Mars from his Ted Talk, and naturally wanted to hear someone talk about design more. I spent a lot of my day doing research. But this research was the boring type of research where you log data into the computer... and nothing else. So naturally, I decided to listen to some of his podcasts as I was carrying out my tasks. So here down below, will be some notes that I want to personally remember from listening to these ~15 minute podcast recordings. Enjoy!</p>
                    <p><b>Best Enjoyed By</b> - this particular podcast spoke about the design of those printed labels on everyday produce. I think the important takeaway here is that you can't always know when a food will expire. Calm down a bit next time your milk or bread says something like that, and just know that no one knows exactly when something will "expire." Expire as in taste bad won't necessarily kill you, but make sure that those dairy products that you get don't taste bad AND kill you.</p>
                    <p><b>Bone Music</b> - This one was really cool. So during the USSR's reign, propaganda from the west was severely blocked right? Soviets were shielded from any culture that promoted non-communist ideas. Well because of this, music in particular was fancied by a lot of people who lived in the Soviet Union. They wanted access to Jazz and Rock records, but obviously couldn't because they were illegal. Well some guy decided to create some of these records, but getting the legit material for a vinyl disc was very difficult there. So instead, he used these exposed X-Ray scans to encode the music. This lasted longer and was easy to access (i.e. hospitals and medical archives). When these so-called "bone music" became popular, private household kitchens became cultural hot spots for free expression and exchange of ideas. Kinda like in the enlightenment when they had Barbershops. These records would be sold by guys in trenchcoats on the street. The KGB caught on and would send out fake vinyl records that would break players, and cracked down on more and more people.</p>
                    <p><b>Tube benders</b> - Neon lights! There was a time when they were only for luxurious places. Eventually, when the lights died out, they would be expensive to up-keep. Many became upgraded to LED lights and therefore Neon Lights started to die out. The flickering neon light started to become a metaphor for loneliness. Now there's a slight comeback for keeping Neon lights alive, but really... things have changed over time.</p>
                    <p><b>Pagodas and Dragon Gates</b> - Chinatown and Chinese people... much relevant to me. There was a time when Chinese people were extremely discriminated against. I'm talking the Chinese Exclusion Act.... I'm talking when there was an earthquake that destroyed San Francisco, Chinatown was not saved due to reasons of white superiority. They instead blew up houses in Chinatown that caught fire after the Earthquake in an effort to stop the fire from spreading. In post-earthquake settings, the city refused to rebuild Chinatown. They wanted to instead relocate those that lost homes, and to rebuild a new place that was more western and "perfect" (WASPS). The Chinese were able to counter this relocation by threatening (in a very peaceful manner) to relocate their Chinese trade connections as well. The city stopped their racism and basically allowed them to rebuild. What the Chinese decided to do with this opportunity to rebuild was great. They hired a white architect and a white engineer. Both didn't know much about China and its culture/traditions. So what they did, was create a very westernized, stereotyped/idealized view of China. These views were clean and non-threatening, so instead of having a thug/Triad type of image, they started to just become very "Chinese" (ching-chong) like. Westerners were attracted to this idealized version and revenue for this tiny little town grew. Win-Win (sort of not really cause it's still kind of discriminatory for Chinese people).</p>
                    <p><b>Worst Smell in the World</b>"Liquid Ass" - something that smells really bad, but was useful to help soldiers practice real-life simulated situations for Iraq.</p>
                    <p><b>Fixing the Hobo Suit</b> - Designing the costumes for superheroes. Make them modern, yet not offensive to the original comic strips. Superman's red underwear? Not cool anymore so let's just make them blue. Let's also put chain-mail under his costume to seem shiny and strong. That kind of stuff. Kind of cool, but not that much for me personally.</p>
                    <p><b>The Landlord's Game</b> - Monopoly. Was actually originally created to make people not want capitalism/monopolies. Wanted to promote another type of tax system, but instead made people like the game. The game was first idealized with "Landlord's Game" which didn't have much visuals, but the idea was there. Then a guy took that idea and developed it for himself by adding better visuals and more (i.e. street names), sold them to people. Later that was acquired and it became popularized on a national scale.</p>
                    <p><b>Fountain drinks</b> - Water fountains were a thing back then. But they were created with these cups that you pour into and share with everyone. You're then supposed to then replace that cup for the next person for sanitary purposes. Then they designed another type that shot water vertically straight up. People just put their mouths on them and drank from there. Was not sanitary as well... So the final iteration is what we have today. And incidents like the UCF "Watergate" incident caused regulations to give water to everyone, everywhere in public settings. Think about how it was back then, when alcohol was the cheapest thing to get access to and "water" was from the river. A.k.a. water was SUPER unsanitary. So people just drank alcohol for their liquids... not water. This water fountain was something that provided people who didn't want to be intoxicated all of the time a new primary option. People involved with the temperance movement (prohibition supporters) especially approved of this new adaption of water rather than alcohol. Isn't that kind of neat? Something we sort of ignore nowadays was treasured for people back then. Also, another cool thing that I learned: A guy named John Snow discovered that Cholera was caused by unsanitized water. He is known to be the "father of modern epidemiology."</p>
                    <p><b>Butterfly effect</b> - The design of ballots in the U.S. is oddly still not that great... Prime example: 2000 Election - Bush v. Al Gore. Florida was the deciding state that would determine the presidential winner. Guess what? They had to do 2 manual recounts, and to be completely honest, it may have not been completely truthful. Not only were about 12,000 people not allowed to vote due to prejudice, but also the design of the voting ballot in certain places were poorly designed. In Palm Beach, FL county, there was something known as the "butterfly ballot." They required the voters to punch a hole into a paper to essentially vote for the person you wanted. Well for this paricular slip of paper, Bush was at the top and was clear when you wanted to vote for him. Al Gore, however, was down third in line. Some guy who wasn't very popular was sandwiched in between. According to the data after the election, that sandwiched guy was oddly high in the count. This was weird because it was probably a mistake in the interpretation of these ballots. These ballots were sometimes not able to fully be read by the machine (i.e. not fully punched through), and when they were recounted manually, they were easily misinterpreted by people as to who the person actually wanted to vote for. From the understanding of this ballot ticket, to the interpretation of it.... the butterfly ballot kind of sucks. The weird thing is that the U.S. has local systems for elections (i.e. every county decides what system they use). This means that bad design can happen anywhere since there's no standard. This is a serious problem, but to be completely honest it's not completely uncalled for. The amount of voting one could do is very different from county to county. So therefore when you want to vote for something that is particular to a state, the system would have to allow for this.</p>
                    <p>I'm telling you design is cool.</p>

                    <p>Continuing on with this "I can't stop thinking about the future phase... I also can't stop looking up food and shopping online for cookware. I legit picture myself making all these dishes when I have the kitchen and place for it, but that won't be until a couple months later. It's always a pain for me to get groceries, but I picture my life being 10x better if I just had that easy access and that simple, comfy life in 8 months.</p>
                    <p>I went grocery shopping again, as well as self-indulged with some more Chipotle today. It was great, but I always end up feeling pretty darn guilty afterwards. I don't know why... I definitely have the money now, but it's still that weird sense of habit that I have developed this past year. It's good, but it's not the most healthy. Hopefully I won't be lazy this week and actually utilize the stuff that I bought.</p>

                    <p>I keep thinking about the future rather than the here and now. I can't help but to be extremely excited about the summer... I can't help but to picture myself living in a studio apartment by myself... No seriously, that one especially. I have been obsessing over furniture and random apartment-warming items that I definitely don't need as of right now.</p>
                    <p>It has become a genuine concern of mine to contemplate on whether or not I should buy a certain gadget, just because it would be nice to have for a place to myself. I want to be able to walk down to the grocery store and buy necessities, and I especially want to be able to cook all of the things that I have always wanted to learn how to cook.</p>
                    <p>I'm lazy now, so it seems like it's a good indicator of how I'll be like in the future, but I'm confident that this laziness only comes from being so far away from the grocery store that I actually want to shop at.</p>
                    <p>The sucky thing about this constant mind-drift is that I tend to over-hype my living situation for the future. I for sure won't know if I will get a spot in Kennilworth, but I am depending my current happiness on that fact. Hopefully, that comes to me sometime in April so I won't have to worry as much anymore, but if not... man on man will I be homeless :(.</p>

                    <p>Got back to the burgh' today. Surprisingly, a friend of mine was on the same plane ride back from TPA to PIT. We didn't know it, but it was pretty fun to have some company on the depressing 28X ride back to campus.</p>
                    <p>It is BEYOND cold here. Being back in the warm temperatures of Florida will surely be missed, but time to adjust my sleep schedule, motivation, and body comfort to cold temperatures again. I'm excited for a new year, but it's always sort of tiring and dreadful...</p><hr>

                    <h3>January 9, 2016 - Saturday</h3>
                    <p>Tomorrow, I leave to go back to Pittsburgh. There's always this weird feeling when I leave home, and quite frankly, I don't think I'll ever get used to it. I'm pretty adaptable to my surroundings, and when I am in a certain place, I typically don't think about other places that I could in. Everytime I leave home, I always feel bad leaving my family. It's especially bad this time because I am leaving my mom in a house alone.</p>
                    <p>My brother is up in college and my dad is in San Francisco working. My mother has to stay in this house that was once filled with family, but now is filled with empty furnitures. I feel guilty for leaving to go to school in a different state, even though my life here at home is 100% more easy and relaxing. Here at home, I'm relieved of all responsibilities. I literally get to be a daughter, and that's it. My laundry gets done, my food gets cooked, and everything that I typically do myself when I'm up at CMU, is done by my mommy :).</p>
                    <p>It seems like I dread going up to school because of this reason... this laziness. But in reality, it's only because it pains me to picture my mom alone in the house. I have yet, and probably will never get used to leaving a place. When you've built relationships in a town and memories with people, it's hard to say goodbye, even if it's temporary. I'll hopefully be back in March... but if not, maybe in 6 or so months I'll be back.</p>
                    <p>I wonder if when I get my own apartment in Pittsburgh I'll start to feel differently... That instead of "working" 8 months out of the year just to go home during winter and summer breaks, I'll be vacationing to my old house in Florida and returning to a home in Pittsburgh.</p><hr>

                    <h3>January 8, 2016 - Friday</h3>
                    <p>Happy Friday everyone!</p>
                    <p>Time to ruin that happy note with something a little more serious... I was sitting with my mom and two of her family friends today at dinner. What was the occasion for? Well a family friend of ours actually passed away January 3rd, 2016. His funeral is tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>What struck me odd was their conversation they were having. I don't fully understand the relationship between Paul and my parents/their friends, but I know that at one point, they were pretty close. They would chill at each other's houses and play cards till late hours into the night. But my mom and that friend was able to casually talk about Paul's death. How they weren't able to shed tears for him this past week, and how his death didn't actually strike them like it struck others.</p>
                    <p>For some reason, I found this conversation to be quite cold. But let me explain to you some more background information before you start bashing them for how "cruel" they were. Paul was an alcoholic. He had a beer by his side everytime I saw him. He had health issues earlier, but chose to ignore them. And when it was too late, he was given 3 months to live due to the liver cancer's metastasis. My mom and several of her friends tried to encourage him to stop his habits and to care for his health more, but he never really listened... They drifted apart as friends, and mainly only saw each other at other social gatherings.</p>
                    <p>So sitting there with this knowledge, I didn't feel that what my mom and her friends were saying were really absurd and rude. It was a weird situation where I felt that death is such an unfortunate asshole and that no one deserves to die, but also a situation where I felt that my mom and her friends were making completely valid points. It was a classical logic v. emotion situation.</p>
                    <p>What was weird was how I always imagined people griefing to death... I always thought that people naturally cried and felt emptiness when someone you knew passed. That bringing put their names would bring the table to silence out of respect for the dead. But this didn't happen did it...? It was quite the opposite. It seemed like gossip stirred at the table and within friend groups. Nobody cried at the table, nor did anyone even seem that shaken up by the death.</p>
                    <p>I'm not sure how I'll handle death. I have yet to experience it close to me. I also don't know how I'll be received when I die. Will people not cry about my absence and sit around just talking about it? I don't know... really, and maybe I don't have to think about this until I'm older... but I know the day will come... and I'll try to get an answer back to you.</p>
                    <p>Rest in peace Paul.</p>

                    <p>I did absolutely nothing today.

                    <h3>January 6, 2016 - Wednesday</h3>
                    <p>Today I was faced with a dilemma. It wasn't life changing, nor was it really a big deal... It was the simple decision of whether or not I should stay at home with my mother and my comfortable bed, or go out and hang out with friends in Gainesville, FL.</p>
                    <p>I realize how much of a "first-world problem" this dilemma is, but I think it's still kind of important to reflect on. I decided to not go up and spend about two nights with friends. It would've consisted of laughs and enjoyment, but also a lot of turning up. I don't know about you, but I'm tired of turning up.</p>
                    <p>It's odd to say that because I actually didn't do much of it during my time back in Florida. Maybe I've grown lazier or just more mature, but the idea of relaxing in my queen sized bed or at home with my mom is something that I didn't get a whole lot of this break, and that I certainly valued over the social trip up.</p>
                    <p>I've come to really appreciate the little things in life. But every once in a while I'll forget about that and I'll fall back into this sense of self that I don't think I'm fully comfortable with. It's important to remember what's important to you, and to keep reminding yourself of that when this importance starts to just become a regular thing. For me, this important thing is to spend time with family and to relax. What's yours?</p>

                    <h3>January 5, 2016 - Tuesday</h3>
                    <p>Feeling fresh today after getting a cleaning at the dentists and a haircut. My mom went to work today, but I still needed a ride to the dentists. So conveniently, my mom asked our neighbor / family friend to drive me to and from the place. I can't really express how thankful I am for the little things like this. Nobody has to drive me anywhere quite frankly. It's sort of a "tough luck" situation in my mind. But the fact that this family friend was willing to wait 2 hours for me to run my personal errands, I'm forever grateful.</p>
                    <p>This family friend is leaving to go back to China tomorrow morning, and later to just return to his home in Vancouver. I feel a little bummed out about this, even though I really shouldn't be. I have no real connection with this guy, and have mostly just seen him hanging out around my parents (since they were old school buddies). But I've grown to see him as a distant relative... you know, someone you can't really carry out a full-on conversation with, but can certainly care about and feel sad about when they leave.</p>
                    <p>Welp, that's life isn't it? Until next time Xuqing Shu Shu. Also, thanks for letting me drive the Range Rover today. Twas fun.</p>

                    <h3>January 4, 2016 - Monday</h3>
                    <p>Went to try out "Escape Room" with 6 good ol' high school friends today. We jumped into an intermediate leveled room (which basically just means you get hints later on than those in normal leveled rooms), and kicked some butt! I'd have to say the teamwork game was on fleek today. We scavenged the room quickly and were able to divide up tasks well. With the given 60 minutes, we were able to escape the room with about 10 minutes to spare! As we walked in, we saw a bunch of middle/high schoolers also participating with their own parties. Not going to lie, I thought that the idea was a little childish after seeing them, but I don't even care now since it was a genuinely enjoyable experience!</p>
                    <p>I also upgraded my phone finally after almost 3 years! Said goodbye to my HTC One (M7) and hello to my Samsung Galaxy S6. I don't know why this is relevant at all, but I suppose the idea of this blog was to serve as a virtual journaly which I would update daily. So mark today as my day with a new phone, and in 2 years (cause of that contract), mark it as the end of my relationship with this phone (unless there's no reason to switch).</p>

                    <h3>January 3, 2016 - Sunday</h3>
                    <p>I officially signed and completed my offer from Microsoft today. It's still quite surreal for me to think that I'll be in a foreign state for a whole 12-weeks. Gaining work experience is something that I've always wanted ever since I learned about the awesome opportunities and cultures of tech. companies. But not gonna lie, this is still quite a scary concept for me.</p>
                    <p>I've been rejected from a bunch of companies in the past year. Each time I received a rejection, my confidence in myself as a programmer decreased. I've always believed that working hard will get you to the place that you want, but those rejections really prevented me from believing in that full-heartedly. After receiving that call from Microsoft, I of course gained back that confidence. But it still worries me that my future is not securely locked in place. I still need to work towards a better future for me. I still need to spend those endless nights awake working more than those who are smarter than me. I still need to be the best that I personally want to be. Remember that.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, I'll leave a poem here (one of my favorites that I keep up on my wall at home).</p>
                    <blockquote>
                     Listen to the mustn'ts, child.<br>

                     Listen to the shouldn'ts,<br>
                     the impossibles, the wont's.<br>
                     Listen to the never haves,<br>
                     Then listen close to me...<br>

                    <p>Met up with two of my closest high school friends today at Starbucks. We always ended up at a local Starbucks of ours when we were in high school, sitting for hours: gossiping, reminiscing, inspiring, and joking. Since going to college though, we haven't had much time to ourselves, let alone each other. Every time we meet up now, it's a simple game of "catch-up."</p>
                    <p>I miss these buds, but I feel like the bond we created over these coffeeshop experiences are something that keeps me real. What's that even mean? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that I have these <b>real</b> conversations about life with these two. We talk about how it was in the past, what it is in the present, and what will be of us in the future. It's nice to have these two here with me for conversations that really make you ponder about life.</p>

                    <p>Well today is the first of a new year. I figured I should do something nifty with the "first." Or else I'd sort of have to wait 365 days for another opportunity. I'm going to try my best to enter something every single day until next year, but I genuinely don't have high hopes in this idea. Not because I'm not good at following through with things and can't do it, but most likely because I'll get super busy during the semester and will forget to have time to myself. I will however try to post something small every day. So perhaps a picture will suffice instead of an actual journal/blog entry post. Let's see how this goes shall we?</p>
                    <p>Let's start this first post with the stereotypical "New Year's Resolution," shall we? Now I know how difficult it is to keep these resolutions going, so my definition of a New Year's Resolution is to simply <i>try.</i> This means giving broad goals like "Exercise more than last year" vs. "Exercise X amount of times each week"... <i>'namsayin?</i></p><br>

                    <ul style="font-family: baskerville">
                        <li>Continue this awesome trend of rocking school (keep your grades up, participate and do the things you enjoy, continue research, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Rock your internship this summer at Microsoft! Literally learn anything and everything you possibly can, and also be an awesome team player.</li>
                        <li>Learn more like you have been doing this past year. Maybe look into app development? Anyways, participate in more hackathons, seminars, etc.</li>
                        <li>Look for an apartment to live in for the upcoming 2 years, and when the time comes (aka fall semester 2016), live well in that apartment and balance current and future lifestyles (especially in-regard to socializing).</li>
                        <li><i>Spring semester goal:</i> Get into CMU's HCII double major program! This one may be hard with your GPA, but you hopefully have the research brownie points to get you in.</li>
                        <li>Continue to appreciate the relationships you have. Family of course (call mom more, message brother more, etc.) is an obvious one, but friends as well both back in FL as well as those on campus at CMU.</li>
                        <li>Be more healthy! Eat more healthy and exercise more. I want to also say sleep more, but I feel like that's impossible.</li>
                        <li>Find a new passion! Maybe it'll be related to your major or to tech., maybe it'll be something completely different. Who knows right? But make sure you get that new skill/love under your belt.</li>
                        <li><i>Fall semester goal:</i> Get an internship offer from a tech company you want for the upcoming summer in 2017. This is defintely a long term goal that requires you to do stuff like 1. add on that additional major, 2. continue pursuing interests and projects (do more hackathons), 3. keep on trucking with quadrotor & research, 4. do well at Microsoft, 5. network! [so basically do what you want from the list above and you should be fine]</li>
