                    Club. The subdivision is a project itself, which aims to help
                    spread educational quadrotor kits to high schools around
                    the Pittsburgh area. These kits would help students learn
                    basic programming, promote hobbyism, and introduce concepts
                    of hardware and electrical work. This project is currently
                    in the works so more updates will be available. In the meantime,

                    <p class="project-description">"Snaps v Humanity" combines the popular social application, Snapchat,
                    and the popular card game, Cards Against Humanity. For CMU's
                    TartanHacks 2015, our team built a platform for this mobile
                    game to be easily played by anyone who had access to Snapchat.
                    The game was hosted through a server over the course of
                    TartanHacks, however, since the 24-hour hackathon is over,
                    the server is also down. But if you want to view our work,

                    <p class="project-description">Philly Home Finder helps users find suitable neighborhoods that match their preferences in the city of Philadelphia. For Pennapps Fall 2015, our group created a web application that allows users to set certain parameters based on what they would like to see in their neighborhood (i.e. better education, parks, etc.). The application then takes those parameters and synthesizes them with data from a large collection of civil data for Philadelphia. The application would then map and color code suitable neighborhoods (based on zip-codes) for an easy user experience. We used Flask to develope the framework, as well as Microsoft Azure's DocumentDB for creating the database. Check out our source code
