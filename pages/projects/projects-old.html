                    <h3>November - December 2014</h3>
                    <p>Ezzy World is a simple life-simulating game created
                        with Python's TKinter and Adobe Illustrator. The project
                        was created for Carnegie Mellon University's <i>
                        Fundamentals of Programming</i> course (15-112).

                    <p>The Piairno is a wearable set of gloves that produces
                    musical tones when played. With the aid of flex sensors
                    and Arduino Unos, the concept of an "Air Piano" came to life
                    during Carnegie Mellon University's Build 18 Week 2015
                    (a week long hackathon for engineers at CMU). A link to
                    the project's wiki page can be found

                    <h3>February 6 - 8, 2015</h3>
                    <p>"Snaps v Humanity" combines the popular social application, Snapchat,
                    and the popular card game, Cards Against Humanity. For CMU's
                    TartanHacks 2015, our team built a platform for this mobile
                    game to be easily played by anyone who had access to Snapchat.
                    The game was hosted through a server over the course of
                    TartanHacks, however, since the 24-hour hackathon is over,
                    the server is also down. But if you want to view our work,

                    <h3>May 2015 - Present</h3>
                    <p>Quad Academy is a subdivision of CMU's Robotics Quadrotor
                    Club. The subdivision is a project itself, which aims to help
                    spread educational quadrotor kits to high schools around
                    the Pittsburgh area. These kits would help students learn
                    basic programming, promote hobbyism, and introduce concepts
                    of hardware and electrical work. This project is currently
                    in the works so more updates will be available. In the meantime,
                    however, you can view Quadrotor Club's

                    <h3>August - Present</h3>
                    <p>Wiki-Gen is a Wikipedia Page Generator. A topic is searched
                    on the webpage, and based on the search results, sentences
                    are formed based on Markov Chains and a database of
                    parsed words from Wikipedia pages. Although the articles may
                    not entirely make sense, due to the errors made with this
                    model, the page should relate to typical Wikipedia pages
                    with any generated page. See the
