                    <p>Currently involved in social computing and design research at Carnegie Mellon University's HCII Protolab. Working on a project entitled "Peer Presents" by helping the development of the web application.

                    <h3>September 2014 - Present</h3>
                    <p>Started out as a TA for a student taught course (STUCO) at Carnegie Mellon University. Helped develop the curriculum and materials needed for the deployment of the actual class in Spring 2015. The class was geared towards non-technical students who wanted to learn more about "hobbyism" and aerial robotics. Towards the end of Spring 2015, Quadrotor STUCO merged with Quadrotor Robotics, creating the Quadrotor Project.
                        We are a group of students who are now involved with research and development aspects of Quadrotor, while also maintaining ties with education. Quad Academy is a subdivision of CMU Quadrotor Project.</p></div>

                        <p>Performed power consumption measurements to map out relationships between power and clock frequencies. Predominantly worked with the Raspberry Pi to conduct measurements on its components. Recorded and noted the trends in the various parts of the Pi by running matrix multiplication calculations using BLIS software.</p></div>

                        <p>Research with Dr. Kun Yang on the subject of <b>quantum entanglement </b> and its effects on the advancement of modern technology. Researched in the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, FL. Presented research findings in poster session for staff members of Florida State University. This research project derived from the Young Scholars Program at FSU, a STEM-based program for rising juniors in Florida.</p></div>
<!--For me, this 6 week program means much more than a spot on my résumé. It's where I found myself surrounded by truly remakarble people. People that I tend to forget about as my life piles on with work and laziness. I believe this body of text above doesn't explain how important this experience really was for me. It's where my interests in the STEM field peaked and ultimately set its track to where I am today; it's where I met people who I look up to and consider not only academic role models, but people that I'm really darn lucky to call friends; it's where I found to truly appreciate connections with people that you can goof around with at odd hours in the night and yet still listen to them ramble on about intellectual jargon that is WAY out of my reach. From the bottom of my heart, thank you all for making those 6 weeks memorable, and for showing that nerds can be cool too :). 

Also thank you Barbara and Erica (and FSU) for allowing me to enjoy such a wonderful experience. Please keep up the great work!!-->
