                    <h3>September 2015 - Present</h3>
                        <p>Currently involved in social computing and design research at Carnegie Mellon University's HCII <a href="http://protolab.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Protolab</a>. I'm currently working on a project entitled "Peer Presents" by helping the development of the web application. Peer Presents is a tool that allows presenters to receive real-time feedback from their peers, as they're presenting. </p>
                        <p>My personal involvement with this project consists of attending weekly SCRUM and team meetings to determine what the following week's Sprint goal is. Based on these meetings, I help develop the code for a certain new feature or solution to a bug. These developments vary from week-to-week depending on what research topic we wish to pursue. You can see the tool itself by using the following <a href="http://peerpresents.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">link</a>. </p>
                        <p>Peer Presents is powered by a Heroku server, and uses a mongoose database server for storage. It uses NodeJS for the backend, which includes Jade templating and Express as a framework. It also uses Sockets.IO for direct communication between users and the server. To be completely honest, I'm not that great with the technical lingo/description of Peer Presents, but if you want to learn more about the project or even work on it, feel free to e-mail me and we can chat up some in-depth details.</p>

                    <div class="text">
                    <h3>September 2014 - Present</h3>
                    <p>Started out as a TA for a student taught course (STUCO) at Carnegie Mellon University that specialized in Quadrotors. Helped develop the curriculum and materials needed for the deployment of the actual class in Spring 2015. The class was geared towards non-technical students who wanted to learn more about "hobbyism" and aerial robotics. Towards the end of Spring 2015, Quadrotor STUCO merged with Quadrotor Robotics, creating the Quadrotor Project.</p>
                    <p>We are a group of students who are now involved with research and development aspects of Quadrotor, while also maintaining ties with education. Quad Academy is a subdivision of CMU Quadrotor Project, and is the specific field which I am involved with.</p>
                    <p><b>Quad Academy</b> specifically gears towards the development of an easily accessible quadrotor kit and curriculum to deploy to high schools. As a program manager for the team, I am constantly involved with the creation and adaptation of this kit so that the kit is not only academically beneficial to students, but also a propeller in students' future enthusiasm for the STEM field. We're working to create a cost-effective kit that is safe to deploy to high school students, as well as a kit that is self-sufficient. With rising interests and applications in quadcopters, we're able to introduce technical concepts such as physics, hardware engineering, and computer programming all while engaging students' interests in aerial technology. <i>This semester at Carnegie Mellon (Spring 2015), Quad Academy will be teaming up with Project Ignite to deploy our prototype kit to 6 high school students around the local Pittsburgh area. More exciting updates to come!</i></p></div>

                        <h3>February 2015 - May 2015</h3>
                        <p>Performed power consumption measurements to map out relationships between power and clock frequencies. Predominantly worked with the Raspberry Pi to conduct measurements on its components. Recorded and noted the trends in the various parts of the Pi by running matrix multiplication calculations using BLIS software.</p>
                        <p><i>This research experience marked my first paid job, but also my first real (and serious) pursuit of academics outside of my classes. It involved working with a close-knit team of four people applying classroom definitions to hands-on applications, as well as communicating with graduate students and an assistant research professor. The research that I was doing in this lab, however was still a bit distant from what I really wanted to do with my major, so after a semester of easing myself into academic research, I decided to depart from the lab to join one more closely aligned with my interests.</i></p> 
                        <p><i>But nevertheless, thank you to Richard, Tze Meng, and Guiling for easing me into research. If CPU power efficiency sounds interesting to you...

                        <p>Research with Dr. Kun Yang on the subject of <b>quantum entanglement </b> and its effects on the advancement of modern technology. Researched in the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, FL. Presented research findings in poster session for staff members of Florida State University. This research project derived from the Young Scholars Program at FSU, a STEM-based program for rising juniors in Florida.</p>
                        <p><i>For me, this 6 week program means much more than a spot on my résumé. It's where I found myself surrounded by truly remakarble people. People that I tend to forget about as my life piles on with work and laziness. I believe the body of text above doesn't explain how important this experience really was for me. It's where my interests in the STEM field peaked and ultimately set its track to where I am today; it's where I met people who I look up to and consider not only academic role models, but people that I'm really darn lucky to call friends; it's where I found to truly appreciate connections with people that you can goof around with at odd hours in the night and yet still listen to them ramble on about intellectual jargon that is WAY out of my reach.</i></p>
                        <p><i>From the bottom of my heart YSPers, thank you all for making those 6 weeks memorable, and for showing that nerds can be cool too :).<br> Also thank you Barbara and Erica (and FSU) for allowing me to enjoy such a wonderful experience; it really did make a difference in me. Please keep up the great work!
