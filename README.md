  I enjoy web development and decided to give it a swing last summer,
  but this is my first rodeo so let me know if there are 
  any bugs, uglies, questions, etc. Find my contact
  information in the menu! Good-day mates!
            
            
  Notes: I realize that some pages are slow and load incorrectly.
  Not exactly sure why, although I'm guessing it has something to do
  with JS's async loads. I am trying to work on it, but for the mean time,
  if you do encounter a weird page, please just refresh it a few times
  until it looks normal. I'm so sorry! I've tried combing through
  Stack Overflow but every implementation that i've tried hasn't really
  done the trick. I'll eventually fix this issue but, until then, sorry!

  Check up on my progress every once in awhile because I'll be updating
  things as I learn & grow (not taller, just wiser). The "Interests" page
  is especially not done (it's at an acceptable minimum right now) and I'll
  be updating that when time permits.
  
  Thanks for reading! Since this was my personal website (project), my 
  documentation/comments/style overall isn't great.
