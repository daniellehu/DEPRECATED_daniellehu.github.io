                            Without diving too much into details, Microsoft&rsquo;s WPT has an internal
                            website that displays pertinent information to our team about website domains (i.e. bug information,
                            trend information, etc.). In order to create a more efficient experience while browsing websites, our team
                            decided to create an extension that paralleled our internal website. This meant
                            working on a relatively new technology for Microsoft Edge (since extensions only
                            started rolling out in the Windows Anniversary Edition). The backend was built in C#, while the frontend
                            was built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.<br><br>

                            Our goal for this STUCO was to spread awareness and understanding of the technologies behind
                            Quadrotors, even if one had no technical background.<br><br>

                            developing a station where LiPo batteries can safely and effectively be swapped out for a new pair.

The majority of the code base was already implemented from the summer, so I mostly joined to help debug and implement new changes to the system. I worked closely with another undergraduate student who served as the team&rsquo;s designer, a PhD student who served as a developer, and our PhD lead over the course of the Fall semester. Our team improved the UI/UX of the overall system, fixed remaining bugs from the summer, and then implemented an A/B test that was deployed for testing towards the end of the semester.<br>

                            Our team&rsquo;s designer came up with a new logo, button design and placement, color scheme, etc. For the first few
                            weeks of being a web developer for this team, I was heavily involved with frontend work in order to make PeerPresents
                            more presentable to our users. We needed to be able to deploy our system to classrooms and therefore wanted to focus
                            on improvements of the UI.<br><br>
                            &bull; Provided feedback for the reworking of a new UI during weekly SCRUM sessions and team meetings<br>

                            &bull; Changed application to be more mobile and tablet friendly<br>

                            <i><u>Implementing A/B test:</u></i><br>
                            Towards the latter part of the semester, our team wanted to test new features to further the study of optimizing our tool. Brainstorming for this new topic was a process that took a few weeks, but in the end, we decided to test the impact of the tool&rsquo;s interface on the user&rsquo;s actions. In particular, we wanted to know whether a split version of an interface versus a combined version of an interface led to people commenting / voting more. For our system, people can comment their own thoughts. In addition, they can look at other feedback given from their peers and vote on  those feedback. We decided to implement an AB-test where version A supported a split interface and version B supported a combined view. We hypothesized that the split display would lead to more commenting and less voting since switching between the tabs may be a deterring factor, and that the combined display would lead to less and more conservative commenting from users, yet more votes for other comments.<br><br>
                            Our team brainstormed the design of the whole test and the interface of the new system in the first few weeks. Afterwards, it was a matter of implementing the two versions in our existing code-base. We randomly assigned the students to either group A or group B. Their account names were tracked in our database in order to figure out the switching of the groups. So for the first 2 weeks students in group A witnessed a split view of the interface, while the rest of the students spent it in group B with the combined views. After 2 weeks, we simply switched the students to the opposite group.<br><br>

                            Our web application needed to be fully functional for our classroom deployments. We planned to deploy to a particular class and have them use PeerPresents versus handwritten notecards for feedback. This process of deploying meant that we had to focus on any bugs present in our system.<br><br>

                            In spring of 2016, my role in Peer Presents involved less development, and more analysis of our datasets. After deploying to two classrooms in the fall semester, our team gathered over 6000 real-time feedback comments from actual students in a classroom setting. I digitized a lot of the non-PeerPresents feedback comments that were provided by students on notecards. This step was rather long and tedious, but after a lot of the data was sorted and imported into excel sheets, our analysis of the actual data started kicking in.
                            <br><br>
                            I, along with our PhD lead and our other PhD developer, worked on coding the feedback comments that we received. This 'coding' meant categorizing each comment by a student into respective labels. These labels help provide more context to whether or not PeerPresents is a more/less effective system for feedback commenting. Although I fixed bugs here and there, the majority of my work in the second semester involved reading notecards and excel sheets to try and clean the process of analyzing the data.<br><br>
